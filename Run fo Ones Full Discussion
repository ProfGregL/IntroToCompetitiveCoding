 Run of Ones
 
Problem Description:

This problem was asked by Stripe.
Given an integer n, return the length of the longest consecutive run of 1s in its binary representation.
For example, given 156, you should return 3

156 in binary -> 10011100 



create binary string representation  bs 
starting from left i = 0

count = 0
max count = 0

while i < length of string {
if bs[i] == 1{
	count ++ 
	}
if bs[i] == 0  run is over,  check for max
	if count > maxcount{
 	maxcount = count  
	count = 0
	}
	
if bs[i] == EOF{
		return maxcount	
	}
i++
}

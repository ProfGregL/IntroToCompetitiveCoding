Problem Description:

Let's define a "sevenish" number to be one which is either a power of 7,or the sum of unique powers of 7. The first few sevenish numbers are 1, 7, 8, 49, and so on.

Create an algorithm to find the nth sevenish number.





Problem Discussion:

â€‹You are given two different requirements.  My suggestion is to work the problem by hand for the first few and see the pattern.

7^0 = 1        1

7^1 = 7         7, 7+1 = 8

7^2=49         49,49+1 = 50, 49+7 = 56

..............



Note that there are no repeats in the sum



Data Structures:    I highly suggest using a vector and a queue
